This is a project I created on my own time while working at Yard Works. I created
it using Python/ Django to expand upon the company's ERP capabilities. Orignally
the project was for learning purposes, the company evetually found use of it
while wait for their new cloud-based platform.

This is not the full version but rather a prototype for public viewing. Some data
displayed has been altered to protect private information.
